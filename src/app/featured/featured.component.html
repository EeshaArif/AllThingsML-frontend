          <h4><b>A Better World Awaits</b></h4>
          <p>
            Happy New Year and welcome to 2021!
          </p>
          <p>
            Amidst the turmoil and heartbreak of 2020, the narrative around big data was redefined. Our focus shifted from personal gain to how we can use data science for the good of people everywhere. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This year, we saw more articles than ever before about using data science and machine learning to model pandemics, predict wildfires, uncover racial discrimination in our institutions and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            We hope that data science can provide insight into urgent social, environmental, and political challenges.

            2020 has been quite a year, and we are grateful to have spent it with you. 
          </p>

          <p>
            This year reminded us repeatedly that data and the data science community are astonishingly powerful tools for understanding and improving our lives. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We have been amazed by the ways this community has come together to analyze information and freely share what we discovered.

          <h4><b>Emerging Problems in Data Science and Machine Learning

</b></h4>
          <p>
            How can we ensure that data science and machine learning technologies evolve in a way that benefits humanity?
            
          </p>
          <p>
           We have realized over time that important problems are emerging from the progress in our field. Problems related to privacy, interpretability, and alignment, for example. 
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why we decided to reach out to our community and research what the potential issues facing our field are and how we can help resolve them. If you’re interested in contributing to any of these topics, you can submit an article to our team. 
          </p>

          <p>If selected, your article will be featured longer in our publication, posted on our social media, and emailed to readers via our newsletter.

          <p>
            Our Best Career Advice
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve realized that trying to become a data scientist is like drinking from two firehoses. The first firehose is technical. You have to browse blog posts, online courses, Kaggle competitions and bootcamps, and learn about everything from AUC scores and hyperparameter tuning to clustering algorithms and deep neural networks. 

          <p>
            This one’s a pain to deal with, but it gets a lot of attention, and there are great resources our there to help most people wrap their heads around it, provided they put in the time.

          </p>

          <p>
            But the second is just as important. This is the career advice firehose — the set of information that helps you to decide what jobs you should target to break into data science, and how you can stand out among the sea of other applicants.
